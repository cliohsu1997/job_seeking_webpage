# Read It First

**Cursor Rule:** Before starting or continuing a conversation, read this file to stay aligned on context, priorities, and rules.

1. Double-check the `conversation_cursor` folder for today’s date and review the latest entries in `progress`, `structure`, and `to-do-list`.
2. Confirm that any new request aligns with previously recorded goals to avoid duplicate work.
3. Mention this file when summarizing updates so the user knows the rule is being followed.
