# Read It First

**Cursor Rule:** Before starting or continuing a conversation, read this file to stay aligned on context, priorities, and rules.

1. Double-check the `conversation_cursor` folder for today’s date and review the latest entries in `progress`, `structure`, and `to-do-list`.
2. Confirm that any new request aligns with previously recorded goals to avoid duplicate work.
3. Mention this file when summarizing updates so the user knows the rule is being followed.

**Coding & Workflow Rules:**
- Break each argument out on its own line when writing or explaining code snippets.
- Preserve the `load  → transform → export` structure as the default flow for any coding work.
- When analysis is involved, summarize the resulting tasks into discrete, small items stored inside today’s dated folder (e.g., `conversation_cursor/dates/2025-12-31`).
- Always explain the code in the cursor window before implementing or sharing it.
- Keep the workflow conversational; treat each exchange as part of that dialogue.
- Create a proposal for new work inside today’s dated folder. Name the file starting with a verb (for example `create-cursor-rule.md`) so it clearly states the action.
- After writing execution files and testing them, log the latest updates inside `conversation_cursor/progress`, `conversation_cursor/structure`, and `conversation_cursor/to-do-list`.
