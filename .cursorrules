# Cursor Rules for Job Seeking Webpage Project

## MANDATORY: Read read_it.md First

**CRITICAL RULE:** Before starting ANY operation, conversation, or task, you MUST:
1. Read the `read_it.md` file in the project root
2. Read `conversation_cursor/progress/latest.md` for high-level pipeline status
3. Read `conversation_cursor/structure/latest.md` for project structure
4. Read the most recent dated to-do list (`conversation_cursor/to-do-list/YYYY-MM-DD_task.md`) for explicit tasks
5. Check today's dated folder in `conversation_cursor/dates/YYYY-MM-DD/` for context
6. Confirm that any new request aligns with previously recorded goals to avoid duplicate work
7. Mention `read_it.md` when summarizing updates so the user knows this rule is being followed

This rule applies to EVERY conversation start and should be the first action taken.
