# Cursor Rules for Job Seeking Webpage Project

## MANDATORY: Read read_it.md First

**CRITICAL RULE:** Before starting ANY operation, conversation, or task, you MUST:
1. Read the `read_it.md` file in the project root
2. Review the latest entries in `conversation_cursor/progress`, `conversation_cursor/structure`, and `conversation_cursor/to-do-list`
3. Check today's dated folder in `conversation_cursor/dates/` for any relevant context
4. Confirm that any new request aligns with previously recorded goals to avoid duplicate work
5. Mention `read_it.md` when summarizing updates so the user knows this rule is being followed

This rule applies to EVERY conversation start and should be the first action taken.

## Project-Specific Workflow Rules

### Code Formatting
- Break each argument out on its own line when writing or explaining code snippets
- Always explain the code in the cursor window before implementing or sharing it

### Default Workflow Structure
- Preserve the `load → transform → export` structure as the default flow for any coding work

### Task Management
- When analysis is involved, summarize the resulting tasks into discrete, small items stored inside today's dated folder (e.g., `conversation_cursor/dates/YYYY-MM-DD`)
- Create a proposal for new work inside today's dated folder. Name the file starting with a verb (for example `create-cursor-rule.md`) so it clearly states the action
- After writing execution files and testing them, log the latest updates inside:
  - `conversation_cursor/progress/latest.md`
  - `conversation_cursor/structure/latest.md`
  - `conversation_cursor/to-do-list/latest.md`

### Communication Style
- Keep the workflow conversational; treat each exchange as part of that dialogue
