# Environment Management Tools

This folder contains configuration and lock files for environment management tools (Poetry, etc.).

## Contents

- `poetry.lock`: Poetry lock file (for reproducible builds)
- Other environment management tool configurations

## Note

While `poetry.lock` is stored here for organization, Poetry also requires it in the project root. A symlink or copy may be needed depending on your setup.
