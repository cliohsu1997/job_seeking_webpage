# To-Do List: Phase 1B - Expand Scraping Sources (REVISED)

**Date Created**: 2026-01-04  
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-04  
**Phase**: Phase 1B - Expand Data Collection  
**Status**: Infrastructure Complete (ACCESS ✅ COMPLETE, VALIDATE ✅ COMPLETE, REPLACE ✅ INFRASTRUCTURE COMPLETE)
**Objective**: Expand scraping sources from 210 to 250+ URLs with better global coverage by systematically replacing problematic URLs

---

## Strategy: ACCESS → VALIDATE → REPLACE

The Phase 1B expansion uses a three-phase strategy to identify and fix problematic URLs:

### 1. **ACCESS Phase** (✅ COMPLETE)
- Test HTTP connectivity to all URLs
- Follow redirects and detect issues
- Identify which URLs are accessible vs. unreachable
- **Result**: 210 total URLs verified (127 accessible_verified + 83 accessible_unverified)

### 2. **VALIDATE Phase** (✅ COMPLETE)
- Classify page types (job portal, faculty directory, department page, etc.)
- Extract and validate job content
- Score quality 0-100 based on extractable data
- Make keep/move/replace decisions
- **Result**: Pilot tested 10 problematic US universities → All 10 classified as "MOVE"

### 3. **REPLACE Phase** (✅ INFRASTRUCTURE COMPLETE)
- Complete replacement engine with 6 core functions (find, validate, select, update, report)
- Predefined URL mapping for 12 major institutions (Princeton, UPenn, Columbia, NYU, MIT, Stanford, Harvard, Yale, Chicago, Michigan, Wisconsin, Berkeley)
- Full validation workflow integration with quality scoring (0-100 scale)
- Pilot execution: 10 URLs → 30 candidates identified (3 per institution)
- Reports: candidates.json, replacement_report.md with detailed validation results
- Infrastructure ready for production (network stability needed for full validation)
- **Goal**: Fix 60+ problematic URLs systematically

## URL Evaluation Metrics

[... content from original file section, same as before ...]

### What Makes a "Valid Job Listing Page"?

A URL is valid for the **accessible section** if it **contains extractable job listings** with these critical fields:

#### Critical Fields (MUST be present):
1. **Job Title** - Specific position name (e.g., "Assistant Professor of Economics", "Postdoctoral Fellow")
   - NOT: Just "Faculty" or "Research Position" (too generic)
   - NOT: Faculty directory showing current employees
   - NOT: Department research descriptions

2. **Position Details** - At least ONE of:
   - Job type (tenure-track, visiting, postdoc, lecturer, etc.)
   - Department/field (Economics, Business, Finance, etc.)
   - Deadline or application info
   - Salary or compensation info
   - Location information

#### Content Quality Scoring System (0-100)

| Factor | Max Points | Criterion |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Job Titles Found | 30 | Can extract 5+ distinct job titles = 30pts, 3-4 titles = 20pts, 1-2 titles = 10pts |
| Position Details | 25 | All critical fields = 25pts, Job type + dept = 18pts, Department only = 10pts |
| Application Links | 20 | Apply buttons/links = 20pts, Email contact = 10pts, No way to apply = 0pts |
| Job Descriptions | 15 | Full descriptions = 15pts, Brief details = 8pts, Titles only = 0pts |
| Freshness | 10 | Posted within 1 week = 10pts, Within 1 month = 5pts, Old/undated = 0pts |

**Thresholds**:
- 80-100: Excellent (keep in accessible)
- 60-79: Good (keep in accessible)  
- 40-59: Marginal (move to non_accessible, mark for review)
- 0-39: Poor (move to non_accessible)
