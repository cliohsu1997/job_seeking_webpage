# To-Do List: 2026-01-02 - Improve Data Quality

**Corresponds to**: Phase 2F: IMPROVE DATA QUALITY in `conversation_cursor/progress/latest.md`

**Reference**: See `data/processed/DIAGNOSTIC_ANALYSIS.md` for detailed problem analysis, statistics, and recommendations.

## Context

After running the pipeline with real data (176 files), diagnostic analysis revealed:
- **0 valid listings** out of 500 after deduplication
- **3,565 critical errors** and **1,995 warnings** (initial)
- **Main issue**: Missing required fields from source webpages (2,876 instances - 76.2%)
- **Secondary issue**: Invalid URL formats - relative URLs (362 instances - 9.6%)
- **Minor issue**: File read errors (7 instances - 0.2%)

The pipeline is working correctly; the issues stem from incomplete data extraction from source webpages, not processing errors.

## Phase 2F: IMPROVE DATA QUALITY Tasks

### 📊 Analysis & Planning
- [x] Review `data/processed/DIAGNOSTIC_ANALYSIS.md` in detail
- [x] Analyze CSV output (`data/processed/jobs.csv`) to identify patterns in missing data
- [x] Review diagnostic reports in `data/processed/diagnostics/` for specific error patterns
- [x] Identify which fields should be critical vs. optional based on data availability
- [x] Document data availability patterns by source type (university vs. institute vs. AEA)

### 🔧 Fix URL Resolution (362 instances - 9.6% of issues) ✅ MOSTLY COMPLETED

#### Normalizer URL Resolution ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Update `scripts/processor/normalizer.py` to resolve relative URLs
- [x] Store base URL during scraping for later resolution (uses source_url from listing)
- [x] Implement URL resolution logic using `urllib.parse.urljoin()` or similar
- [x] Handle special cases: `mailto:`, `javascript:`, anchor links (`#`)
- [x] Add validation to ensure resolved URLs are absolute
- [x] Test with real data to verify URL resolution works
- [x] **FIXED**: Parser manager now looks up base URLs from config and stores in listings as `_base_url`
- [x] **FIXED**: Normalizer now uses `_base_url` from parser manager (highest priority) for URL resolution
- [x] **FIXED**: Enhanced URL resolution to handle relative URLs with leading `/` and without
- [x] **FIXED**: Added fallback base URLs support (tries multiple base URLs if primary fails)
- [ ] Update tests to cover URL resolution scenarios (tests still need updating)

#### Scraper Base URL Storage ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Update scrapers to store base URL with each extracted listing (source_url already stored)
- [x] Ensure `source_url` field contains absolute URL when available (already done in scrapers)
- [x] Pass base URL through parser manager to normalizer (via source_url in listing)
- [x] **FIXED**: Parser manager now looks up base URLs from scraping_sources.json config based on filename/metadata
- [x] **FIXED**: Base URLs are stored in listings as `_base_url` for normalizer to use
- [x] **FIXED**: Enhanced base URL lookup with partial name matching (exact match first, then partial)
- [x] **FIXED**: Scrapers now always set source_url (use self.url as fallback if missing)
- [x] **FIXED (2026-01-03)**: HTMLParser.extract_links() now accepts base_url parameter and resolves relative URLs to absolute URLs immediately
- [x] **FIXED (2026-01-03)**: All scrapers (university, institute, AEA) updated to pass base_url to extract_links()
- [x] **FIXED (2026-01-03)**: Improved navigation/helper page filtering to exclude non-job pages (like `/jobs`, `/careers`, `/benefits`)
- [x] **FIXED (2026-01-03)**: Added URL validation in extract_links() to skip invalid protocols (mailto, javascript, tel, anchor links)

## Phase 2F Status: 🚀 IN PROGRESS - Significant Progress Made

**Summary**: Addressing data quality issues identified in diagnostic analysis. Focus areas: URL resolution, improved data extraction, tiered validation, and graceful handling of missing data.

**Key Objectives**:
1. ✅ Resolve relative URLs to absolute URLs (362 → 113 instances, 69% reduction)
2. ⏸️ Improve extraction of missing fields (2,876 → 560 instances, 80% reduction) - Remaining are data availability issues

- [x] **Enhanced base URL lookup** - Added partial name matching for better config lookup
- [x] **Improved extraction** - Enhanced requirements and materials detection

### 🔗 Fix Inaccessible URLs (81 URLs with issues)

**Status**: ⏸️ IN PROGRESS - Initial fixes completed for Chinese and international universities, remaining URLs to be fixed later

**IMPORTANT RULE**: Only update URLs in the `non_accessible` section. Do NOT modify URLs in the `accessible` section - those are working fine and should remain unchanged.

**Context**: URL verification run identified 81 URLs that are inaccessible, return errors, or don't contain job content:
- **47 URLs moved from accessible to non_accessible** during verification
- **34 URLs in non_accessible** still have issues (connection errors, 404, 403, etc.)
- **Total: 81 URLs requiring fixes**

**Initial Fixes Completed (2026-01-03)**:
- [x] **Removed Chronicle Vitae** - Deleted from non_accessible section (403 Forbidden)
- [x] **Fixed Chinese universities** - Updated 40+ Chinese universities in non_accessible section from `rsc.*.edu.cn` to `hr.*.edu.cn` (HR portals)
- [x] **Fixed Tsinghua University** - Updated to use official job openings portal: `https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/Faculty___Staff/Job_Openings.htm`
- [x] **Fixed international universities** - Updated several URLs for UK, Australia, France, Singapore universities in non_accessible section
- [ ] **Remaining URLs** - US universities (30+), remaining international universities, and research institutes to be fixed later

**Issue Breakdown by Category**:
1. **Job Portals (1 URL)**:
   - Chronicle Vitae: 403 Forbidden

2. **US Universities (30+ URLs)**:
   - Major universities: Princeton, UPenn, Columbia, NYU, UMich, UW-Madison, Penn State, OSU, UVA, Rice, etc.
   - Issues: No job content verified, HTTP 202 errors, 404 errors, 403 forbidden
   - See `data/config/scraping_sources.json` non_accessible section for complete list

3. **Chinese Universities (40+ URLs)**:
   - Many universities: Tsinghua, Nanjing, Shandong, Jilin, Xi'an Jiaotong, etc.
   - Issues: Connection errors (DNS resolution failures), timeouts, SSL certificate errors
   - Many `rsc.*.edu.cn` domains cannot be resolved

4. **International Universities (10+ URLs)**:
   - UK: Cambridge (403), Edinburgh (404)
   - Australia: Sydney (500), Queensland (connection error), Monash (403), etc.
   - Germany, France, Netherlands, Singapore: Various 404/403 errors

**Issue Types**:
- **403 Forbidden**: Chronicle Vitae, Cambridge, Monash, Deakin, etc. (10 URLs)
- **404 Not Found**: Edinburgh, UTS, Griffith, Wollongong, Curtin, RMIT, etc. (15 URLs)
- **Connection Errors**: Many Chinese universities (DNS resolution failures) (40+ URLs)
- **No Job Content Verified**: Many US universities (URLs accessible but no job listings detected) (30+ URLs)
- **HTTP 202/500 Errors**: UMass Amherst, MSU, UOregon, Sydney, etc. (7 URLs)
- **Timeouts**: NBER, North China Electric Power University (2 URLs)

**Reference URLs**:
- **Verification results**: See output from `poetry run python scripts/scraper/check_config/verify_urls.py`
- **Problematic URLs list**: `data/config/scraping_sources.json` (non_accessible section)
- **URL verification documentation**: `data/config/URL_VERIFICATION.md`

**Tasks** (To be completed later):
- [ ] **Search for replacement URLs** - Use web search and common URL patterns to find working alternatives for remaining problematic URLs
- [ ] **Test replacement URLs** - Verify new URLs are accessible and contain job listings (use `--no-check-accessible` flag to only check non_accessible URLs)
- [ ] **Download business school PDFs** - **IMPORTANT**: When searching/testing URLs or visiting pages:
  - Identify any PDF files or downloadable documents on the page
  - Check if they are business school oriented (job postings, faculty positions, business/economics departments, etc.)
  - If yes, download to `data/raw/` directory (create subdirectory if needed, e.g., `data/raw/business_school_pdfs/`)
  - Save with descriptive filename (e.g., `university_name_department_job_posting.pdf`) to `data/raw/documents/`
- [ ] **Update scraping_sources.json** - Replace remaining problematic URLs with working alternatives (ONLY in non_accessible section)
- [ ] **Re-run verification** - Verify all new URLs work correctly (use `--no-check-accessible` to only check non_accessible URLs)
- [ ] **Document changes** - Update URL_VERIFICATION.md with findings and patterns

**Tools Created**:
- `scripts/scraper/check_config/find_url_replacements.py` - Helper script to test common URL patterns (jobs.*, careers.*, etc.)

**Expected Outcome**: All 81 problematic URLs replaced with working alternatives, increasing accessible URL count and improving data collection coverage.
