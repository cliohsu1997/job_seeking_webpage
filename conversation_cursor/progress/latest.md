# Progress: High-Level Pipeline

## Pipeline Overview

The project follows a **Load → Transform → Export** workflow structure for aggregating economics faculty job listings.

## Pipeline Flow

```
[✅ COMPLETED] Setup → [✅ COMPLETED] Load → [🚀 IN PROGRESS] Transform → [⏸️ PENDING] Export → [⏸️ PENDING] Deploy
```

## What We've Accomplished

### ✅ Phase 0: Project Setup (COMPLETED)
- [x] Project structure designed and documented
- [x] Complete folder structure created
- [x] Poetry virtual environment set up
- [x] Documentation framework established
- **To-Do List**: `2025-12-31_project-setup.md`

### ✅ Phase 1: LOAD - Data Collection (COMPLETED)
**Status**: Core scraper framework implemented

**Key Accomplishments**:
- [x] Scraping strategy proposal created
- [x] Comprehensive scraping sources configuration (176 accessible URLs, 70% success rate)
- [x] URL verification system with Chinese keyword detection
- [x] Base scraper framework with utilities (rate limiter, retry handler, user agent)
- [x] Parser modules implemented (HTML, RSS, text extractor, date parser)
- [x] AEA JOE scraper with RSS/HTML fallback
- [x] Generic university scraper with pattern-based extraction
- [x] Research institute scraper

## What's Next

### 🚀 Phase 2: TRANSFORM - Data Processing (IN PROGRESS)
**Status**: Proposal created, ready to begin implementation

- [x] Phase 2 proposal created with detailed structure and diagnostic tracking
- [ ] Core processing pipeline implementation
- [ ] Data normalizer, enricher, deduplicator, validator implementation
- [ ] Diagnostic tracking system implementation
- **To-Do List**: `2026-01-01_transform-data-processing.md`
- **Proposal**: `conversation_cursor/dates/2026-01-01/proceed-to-phase-2-proposal.md`

### ⏸️ Phase 3: EXPORT - Output Generation (PENDING)
- Waiting for Phase 2

### ⏸️ Phase 4: DEPLOY - Deployment & Automation (PENDING)
- Waiting for Phase 3

## Current Focus

**Phase 2: TRANSFORM - Data Processing** - Processing raw scraped data into clean, structured, and deduplicated job listings with diagnostic tracking to identify root causes of extraction failures.
