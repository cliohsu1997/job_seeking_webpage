# Progress

- Captured today's workspace nourishment by adding the dated summary inside `conversation_cursor/dates/2025-12-31` and recording guiding rules in `read_it.md`.
- Logged movement of the summary folder, creation of the proposal/execution files, and the command sequence that shipped the guidance files to GitHub.
- Created `.cursorrules` file to enforce reading `read_it.md` before any operation (committed to git).
- **NEW**: Designed comprehensive proposal for Economics Faculty Job Aggregator project:
  - Created detailed proposal document (`create-econ-job-aggregator-proposal.md`)
  - Created workflow illustration (`project-workflow-illustration.md`)
  - Created folder structure design (`folder-structure-design.md`)
  - Set up complete folder structure (data/, scripts/, templates/, static/)
  - Created initial configuration files (universities.json, scraping_rules.json)
  - Created README.md and requirements.txt
