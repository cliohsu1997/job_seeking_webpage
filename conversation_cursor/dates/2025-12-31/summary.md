# Conversation Summary 2025-12-31

1. Initialized the repo and published the initial `index.html` landing page, then added `conversation_cursor` guidance folders plus `.gitkeep` placeholders in `progress`, `structure`, and `to-do-list`.
2. Connected the repo to `https://github.com/cliohsu1997/job_seeking_webpage.git`, renamed `master` to `main`, and pushed the first commit.
3. Refined the workspace by moving today’s summary into `conversation_cursor/dates/2025-12-31`, codifying coding/workflow rules in `read_it.md`, and documenting the recent re-organization.
