# Execute Workflow

## Commands Run
- Created `conversation_cursor/dates` and relocated `2025-12-31` into that namespace.
- Added coding/workflow directions to `read_it.md`.
- Saved proposal/execution notes and logged updates in the `progress`, `structure`, and `to-do-list` directories.
- Committed and pushed the new files to `origin/main`.

## Tests
- Verified repository status after each move and after committing/pushing the guidance files. No automated tests were required.
