# Create Conversation Proposal

## Purpose
- Align the workspace with the human’s latest instructions: keep the dated summaries in a nested folder, keep `progress/structure/to-do-list` at the root, and make the coding/workflow rules explicit.

## Tasks
1. Move `conversation_cursor/2025-12-31` into `conversation_cursor/dates/2025-12-31` so the dated folder structure matches the new pattern.
2. Update `read_it.md` with the requested coding conventions (load/data/transform/export flow, explaining code before implementation, etc.).
3. Log today’s actions via proposal/execution files, then report the adjustments inside `progress`, `structure`, and `to-do-list`.
